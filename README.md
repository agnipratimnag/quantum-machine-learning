# Learning with Quantum Computers, Winter in Data Science 2022

Week 1:
<br>
Studied Quantum Computation and Quantum Information covering basic linear algebra, fundamentals of quantum mechanics and basics of quantum information theory.

Week 2:
<br>
Surveyed the Deutsch-Josza Algorithm, how it functions, how it is implemented and how it is faster than the corresponding classical algorithm. Code was implemented with the help of Qiskit tutorials on a Jupyter Notebook.

Week 3:
<br> 
Executed basic quantum circuits on Qiskits using the help of tutorials and tried out demos such as Qubit Rotation and more.

Week 4:
<br>
Implemented a variational quantum classifier, with the aid of a Pennylane demo.
